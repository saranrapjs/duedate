# duedate

This Node.js script will fetch the books you currently have checked out at the library and convert their due dates into Reminders.app reminders.  

I've tested it with the Brooklyn Public Library (my local library!) but it should work with any library that uses BiblioCommons as their catalog provider (e.g. their URL looks like `http://[library name].bibliocommons.com/`);

## background

I go thru seasons of being a delinquent Brooklyn Public Library patron.  While the library will send me an email when a book's due date is approaching, I've found that often this gets lost in the infinite void of email.  The script is based on the premise that the notifications generated by using Apple's Reminders (for Mac & iOS) are *fundamentally more annoying* than just getting email, and therefore more likely prompt my timely return of any given library book.

## installation

Unfortunately, this is Mac-only as it uses AppleScript.  I looked into using CalDav to make it OS-independent, but Apple's CalDav interface very opaque.

You'll also need CasperJS, "an open source navigation scripting & testing utility".  The easiest way to install is by using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), the OS X package manager.  With homebrew installed, do this:

```
brew install casperjs
```

Then install the npm package:

```
npm install duedate
```
